Tuple Out Dice Game is a fun and interactive game for two players. The gist of the game is to be the first player to reach a specified target score. Players take turns rolling three dice while following the rules. 

The rules: 
The goal is to score the most points or reach a target score first.
On each turn, the player rolls three dice.
If all three dice show the same number, the plyer "tupled out" and scores zero points for that turn. 
If two dice show the same number, those dice are "fixed" and cannot be rerolled. The player gets the option to reroll the remaining die.
The player can re-roll any non-fixed die as many times as they want. They can choose to stop and keep the score from the current roll. 
The game ends when one player reaches the target score.

How to run the program: 
Make sure Python is installed on your device.
